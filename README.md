Ripostle The True Peer 2 Peer File Sharing Program

Initially used for Sharing of files with employees over our LAN and eventually on the internet!

Ripostle does not connect to central server like most file sharing programs available today.
All others are semi-peer to peer in the way they send files peer 2 peer but and connect to super node peers that act as central servers (hubs, bots, routers). Our Network is truly built by the peers running our software at any given moment. Ripostle is constantly searching for other Ripostle users to directly connect to.

All data is encrypted in transmission, so you can download and share files with the public or just private users running Ripostle Software.
